\section{Architecture definition}

The code to run on the RISC-V-lite processor is:

\begin{listato}
  \lstinputlisting{./lab3/list/crt0.s}
\end{listato}

The architecture that has been designed is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:lab3:fig1}

\section{Architecture verification}

The architecture has been verified via simulation. Figs. 2 ... $n$ show the obtained waveforms.
In particular, Fig. $n-1$ shows that the pipeline is not sensitive to the memory latency and that the protocol works as expected.
Finally, as shown in Fig, $n$, the total number of clock cycles to execute the \emph{maxx} application is ...

\section{Architecture - logic synthesis results}

The maximum frequency achieved by the architecture is ... with a total area equal to ....
Indeed, Figs. $n+1$ and $n+2$ show slack met and area breakdown.
